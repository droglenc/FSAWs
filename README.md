FSAWs
=====

This is the github page for the FSAWs package for R developed by [Derek Ogle](http://droglenc.wordpress.com/) at [Northland College](http://www.northland.edu/). This package contains functions for constructing and validating standard weight (Ws) equations for fish that were originally in the **[FSA](http://fishr.wordpress.com/fsa/)** package. 

## Installation
This package can be installed from github to your R with the following code

```r
if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools'); require('devtools')
devtools::install_github('FSA','droglenc')
devtools::install_github('FSAWs','droglenc')
```
