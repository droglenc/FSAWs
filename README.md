FSAWs
=====

This is the github page for the FSAWs package for R developed by Derek Ogle at Northland College.  This package contains functions for constructing and validating standard weight (Ws) equations for fish that were originally in the **[FSA](http://fishr.wordpress.com/fsa/)** package.  

## Installation
This package can be installed from github to your R with the following code

```r
if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools'); require('devtools')
devtools::install_github('FSA','droglenc')
devtools::install_github('FSAWs','droglenc')
```

Descriptions of recent changes can be found in the [News.md file](https://github.com/droglenc/FSAWs/blob/master/NEWS.md)
