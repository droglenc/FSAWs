\description{
Computes the standard weight equation using the regression-line-percentile method when given the log(a) and b values for a population of length-weight regression equations.
}
\details{
The main function follows the steps of the regression-line-percentile method detailed in Murphy et al. (1990).  In summary, a predicted weight is constructed for each 1-cm length class from each population from the given \eqn{log_{10}(a)} and \eqn{b} values, the predicted weight at the \code{prob}th percentile (wq) is identified, and a linear regression equation is fit to the \eqn{log_{10}(wq)} and \eqn{log_{10}(midpoint length)} data.

Note that \eqn{log_{10}(a)} and \eqn{b} must be from the regression of \eqn{log_{10}(W)} on \eqn{log_{10}(L)} where W is measured in grams and L is the total length measured in mm.

It appears that Murphy et al. (1990) used \code{qtype=6} in their SAS program.  Types of quantile calculation methods are discussed in the details of of \code{quantile}.

The \code{plot}, \code{coef}, and \code{summary} methods are used to construct a plot (see below), extract the coefficients of the standard weight equation, and find summary results of the \code{lm} object returned by the main function.  The \code{what} argument in the \code{plot} method can be set to \code{"both"}, \code{"log"}, or \code{"raw"}.  The \code{"raw"} plot plots lines on the length-weight scale for each population represented in the \code{log.a} and \code{b} vectors with the resultant standard weight equation superimposed in red.  The \code{"log"} plot constructs a similar plot but on the \eqn{log_{10}(weight)}-\eqn{log_{10}(length)} scale.  The \code{"both"} option produces both plots side-by-side.

If the \code{col.pop} argument is set equal to one of these palettes -- \dQuote{rich}, \dQuote{cm}, \dQuote{default}, \dQuote{grey}, \dQuote{gray}, \dQuote{heat}, \dQuote{jet}, \dQuote{rainbow}, \dQuote{topo}, or \dQuote{terrain} -- and the \code{order.pop=TRUE} then the populations plotted should form a general color gradient from smallest to largest weight in the initial length category.  This will make it easier to identify populations that \dQuote{cross over} other populations.
